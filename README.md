# Data for testing MRtrix3 Python scripts

The automatic testing framework in MRtrix3 will clone/pull this repo to fetch
the testing data needed. The data will only be pulled if the run_tests.sh script is executed with the -scripts option.
To add testing data, please refer to the [`testing/README.md`
file](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/blob/master/testing/README.md) in the [main
MRtrix3 repo](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3) for details.
